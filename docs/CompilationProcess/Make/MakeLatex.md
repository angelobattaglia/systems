## The best Latex writing system (IMHO)

Creating a modular LaTeX document and building it with a Makefile is the best way to streamline the document creation process and enhance maintainability, in my opinion. 
This approach is particularly useful for large documents, such as academic papers, theses, or books, where different sections or chapters can be worked on independently. It's also useful to provide a document that is reproducible from source, especially when letting the community on git-based websites the opportunity to contribute to it.

### 1. Structuring a Modular LaTeX Document

A modular LaTeX document is one where different components of the document
(e.g., chapters, sections, or custom commands) are contained in separate files. 
This makes the document easier to manage, especially for collaborative projects. Hereâ€™s how you might structure it:

- **Main File**: The main LaTeX file that includes the document class, preamble (with packages, custom commands, etc.), and input commands to include other files.
- **Section Files**: Separate `.tex` files for different sections or chapters of the document.
- **Resources**: Other directories may include figures, tables, or additional resources.

An example structure could look like this:

```
main.tex
sections/
  - introduction.tex
  - chapter1.tex
  - chapter2.tex
  - conclusion.tex
figures/
  - figure1.png
  - figure2.png
Makefile
```

In `main.tex`, you would use `\input{sections/introduction}` to include the `introduction.tex` file, and so on for the other sections. This approach keeps your main file clean and focuses only on the document structure.

### 2. Writing a Makefile for LaTeX

A Makefile automates the compilation of your LaTeX document, handling the build process with simple commands. LaTeX documents often need multiple compilation passes to correctly generate tables of contents, lists of figures, and to resolve cross-references.

Here's a simple Makefile template for a LaTeX project:

```makefile
# Makefile for compiling LaTeX documents

# Name of the main LaTeX file without the extension
MAIN = main

# Default target
all: pdf

# Compile PDF
pdf:
    pdflatex $(MAIN)
    bibtex $(MAIN) || true # Run bibtex, ignore errors if no bibliography
    pdflatex $(MAIN)
    pdflatex $(MAIN)

# Clean auxiliary files
clean:
    rm -f *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.log *.toc *.out

# Clean all generated files
distclean: clean
    rm -f $(MAIN).pdf
```

This Makefile defines several targets:

- `all`: The default target, which just redirects to the `pdf` target.
- `pdf`: Compiles the LaTeX document into a PDF, running `pdflatex` and `bibtex` as needed. It runs `pdflatex` multiple times to ensure all references are updated.
- `clean`: Removes auxiliary files generated by LaTeX.
- `distclean`: Removes all generated files, including the final PDF.

To use this Makefile, you would run:

- `make` or `make all` to compile the document into a PDF.
- `make clean` to remove auxiliary files.
- `make distclean` to remove all generated files, including the PDF.

This setup allows for a clean and efficient workflow for managing and compiling modular LaTeX documents, particularly suitable for complex or large-scale projects.
