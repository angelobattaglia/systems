### File System Overview

The file system is a critical component of an Operating System (OS) providing mechanisms for permanent data storage, managing files, directories, and disk partitions.

### Files in Linux

Files store information independently from running programs and power supply interruptions. Conceptually, files represent logically correlated information stored as contiguous address space, encoded electronically.

### Encoding Systems

- **ASCII Encoding**:
  - A widely adopted standard using 7-bit binary to represent 128 characters, initially based on the English alphabet.
  - Extended ASCII expands to 8-bit, allowing for 255 characters including ISO standards like ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1).

- **Unicode Encoding**:
  - Supports over 110,000 characters covering virtually all existing writing systems.
  - Common implementations: UCS, UTF-8 (most used, with variable-length encoding), UTF-16, and UTF-32.

### File Types

- **Textual Files (ASCII)**:
  - Sequence of bytes readable by standard text editors.
  - Line-oriented, differing in newline representation between UNIX/Linux/Mac OSX (`LF`) and Windows (`CR` + `LF`).

- **Binary Files**:
  - Sequences of bits without line or character-oriented restrictions.
  - Advantages include compactness, ease of editing, and fixed structure.
  - Disadvantages include limited portability and editing difficulties.

### Serialization

Serialization converts structured data (e.g., C structures) into a storable format. It's crucial for consistent reading, writing, and network transmission.

### ISO C Standard Library for I/O

I/O in ANSI C provides different methods:

- **Character by Character**: `getc()`, `fgetc()`, `putc()`, `fputc()`
- **Row by Row**: `gets()`, `fgets()`, `puts()`, `fputs()`
- **Formatted I/O**: `scanf()`, `fscanf()`, `printf()`, `fprintf()`
- **Binary I/O**: `fread()`, `fwrite()` for serialized data storage and retrieval, common for binary files.

Buffered I/O operations store data temporarily and flush it to disk periodically or explicitly (`fflush()`).

### File Access and Operations

- **Opening and Closing Files**:
  - Using `fopen()` and `fclose()`, files can be accessed with modes such as read (`r`), write (`w`), append (`a`).
  - In UNIX/Linux, there's no functional difference between text (`"r"`) and binary (`"rb"`) modes.

### POSIX Standard Library (Unbuffered I/O)

Unbuffered I/O involves direct system calls with immediate effect, using mainly five operations:

- **`open()`**:
  - Opens or creates files, specifying access modes (e.g., `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`).
  - Optional flags include creation (`O_CREAT`), truncation (`O_TRUNC`), synchronization (`O_SYNC`), and permission settings (`S_IRUSR`, `S_IWUSR`).

- **`read()`**:
  - Reads a specified number of bytes from files, returning the actual bytes read or zero at EOF.

- **`write()`**:
  - Writes bytes to files, returning bytes written; can synchronize immediately with `O_SYNC`.

- **`lseek()`**:
  - Adjusts the current offset within a file, supporting positioning relative to start (`SEEK_SET`), current position (`SEEK_CUR`), or end (`SEEK_END`). Can create sparse files.

- **`close()`**:
  - Releases file descriptors; occurs automatically at program termination.

### Example Usage

Provided examples demonstrate typical use cases of file reading/writing in C, handling both textual and binary files, with careful error checking and system calls implementation.
