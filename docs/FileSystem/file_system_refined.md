### Information Storage

#### **Overview**
Information storage allows data to be preserved across time, unaffected by various disruptions such as program termination, power loss, or system crashes. Files, as logical entities, encapsulate data in a structured format that is encoded for efficient storage and retrieval.

---

#### **Logical Perspective on Files**
A file is a structured repository of related data, characterized by:
1. **Content**: Numbers, text, images, and other data types stored using standardized encoding systems.
2. **Storage**: Represented as a sequence of bytes within a contiguous address space on a storage medium.

#### **Encoding Systems**

##### **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**  
1. **Original ASCII**:  
   - Contains 128 characters.
   - Includes 32 non-printable control characters and 96 printable symbols.
   - Encoded using 7 bits per character.

2. **Extended ASCII**:  
   - Extends the standard to 8 bits, accommodating 255 characters.
   - Variants include:
     - **ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)**: Western European languages.
     - **ISO 8859-5**: Cyrillic alphabet.
     - Others for Eastern European and additional languages.

##### **Unicode**  
1. **Purpose**: Industrial standard designed to represent characters from all writing systems.
2. **Key Features**:
   - Over 110,000 characters.
   - Includes symbols and scripts across various languages.
3. **Implementations**:
   - **UTF-8**: Variable-length encoding (1-4 bytes).
     - Backward-compatible with ASCII for the first 128 characters.
   - **UTF-16**: Variable-length encoding (2-4 bytes).
   - **UTF-32**: Fixed-length encoding (4 bytes).

#### **File Types**
1. **Textual Files**:  
   - Encoded in ASCII or similar formats.
   - Line-oriented (e.g., newline characters for line breaks differ by OS).
     - Unix/Linux: LF (`\n`).
     - Windows: CR+LF (`\r\n`).

2. **Binary Files**:  
   - Store raw byte sequences, not limited to printable characters.
   - Compact and efficient for numeric data or executables.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Smaller size.
     - Fixed structure simplifies file editing and navigation.
   - **Drawbacks**:
     - Limited portability.
     - Cannot be directly edited using standard text editors.

#### **Serialization**
Serialization converts complex data structures into storable or transmittable formats:
1. Encodes data as a sequential stream of bytes.
2. Enables reconstruction of the original structure during deserialization.
3. Supported in programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby.

#### **File I/O in C**

##### **Standard Library Functions**
1. **Open and Close**:
   - `fopen()`: Opens a file.
   - `fclose()`: Closes a file.

2. **Character-by-Character I/O**:
   - `getc()`, `putc()`: Read/write single characters.

3. **Line-by-Line I/O**:
   - `fgets()`, `fputs()`: Read/write entire lines.

4. **Formatted I/O**:
   - `printf()`, `scanf()`: Process data in specified formats.

5. **Binary I/O**:
   - `fread()`, `fwrite()`: Operate on blocks of data.

##### **POSIX System Calls**
For low-level, unbuffered file access:
- **open()**: Opens a file and returns a descriptor.
- **read()**: Reads bytes from a file.
- **write()**: Writes bytes to a file.
- **lseek()**: Adjusts the file pointer.
- **close()**: Closes the file descriptor.

---

#### **Key Concepts in Binary I/O**
1. Binary files often store serialized data, enabling compact storage.
2. Compatibility issues may arise due to varying architectures (e.g., byte order, field alignment).
