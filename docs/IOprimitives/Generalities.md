## Syscalls to manage files in Linux




## Arguments passed on the command line

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
```

* `argv[0]` is the string your operating system uses to invoke the program (often the path or name of the executable).
* `argv[1]` is the **first** actual command-line argument you passed.
* `argv[2]` would be the second argument, and so on, up to `argv[argc-1]`.

So if you run

```bash
./a.out 4
```

then inside `main`:

* `argc == 2`,
* `argv[0]` points to `"./a.out"`,
* `argv[1]` points to `"4"`.

Be careful: if you access `argv[1]` without checking that `argc > 1`, youâ€™ll invoke undefined behavior when no argument was provided.
